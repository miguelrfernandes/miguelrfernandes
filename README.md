# Miguel Roque Fernandes

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @miguelrfernandes
MSc in Biomedical Engineering at IST, Lisbon

I love coding and have worked on several projects during my academic journey and in my free time.

I have created a [web app](https://www.miguelroquefernandes.com/wodl-solver) with 30k monthly unique users for the last 2 years. It uses vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. At the time, I was learning PHP as a challenge, so this was not a serious project. The project required web scraping, which was done using Puppeteer, Python Selenium, and Python beautifulsoup.

[Next.js Challenge](https://gitfront.io/r/miguelrfernandes/vGGQvyf3HtTc/nextjs-challenge/)
This a quick challenge using Next.js and Python Flask. This is an approach that I'd use if starting a new side project.

[MSc Thesis Project](https://research.miguelroquefernandes.com/)
MSc thesis project built with Next.js and Python in the backend.

[Django App](https://salarios.mfernandes.me/)
An app built with Django some years ago.
